Don't create re-usable UI components for the wrong reasons. If you think, "I'll create one component for all buttons and re-use it, then I can update its styling across the app when the design changes," don't be so sure about that. In all but the smallest apps I've worked on, the idea of making across-the-board changes to any aspect of the design invariably reveals itself to be impractical. The possibility of introducing design regressions is too high. Putting effort into any screen other than the new one being rolled out will be considered too inessential, at least after timelines are considered.

Updating shared styling isn't the only reason to create re-usable components, and I don't think anyone is suggesting as much.
