The web is a creepy place.  Ads follow you around.  You're tracked not only by
what you click on, but also that picture you spent an extra second noticing
when you were scrolling past.  Even when you're not on Facebook, Google, and
Twitter, those companies still know just about everything you read online.  Of
course, companies would never misuse personal data in creepy ways (nor would
they ever sell it to third parties whose names you've never heard
of).<sup>1</sup>

The web didn't used to work like this.  It doesn't have to work like this... wait a minute.... __what if we disabled all these new browser features that enable websites to track us?__

### Notes

1. It's tempting to swear off the internet and these big social media sites altogether.  Then just as quickly you remember that it's how you stay in touch with your social (and family) group, how you find out what's going on, your entertainment, and how you do the most basic things like find out which store/restaurant/business/whatever to buy something from.
