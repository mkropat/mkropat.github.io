My name is Michael. I have been working in the software industry for like 15+ years now. I've been tinkering with code even longer.

Now that I live in Columbus, Ohio, I try to hit [CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/) every year. Hit me up if you are going to be there, I like meeting readers of my blog.
