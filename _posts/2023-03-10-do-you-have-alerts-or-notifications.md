**Quick**: an alert goes off. What do you<sup><a href="{{ page.url }}#note1">1</a></sup> do?

→ Investigate what triggered the alert, probably acting to recover from the situation

→ Glance at the alert and go, "probably normal"

If you identify with the first response, congratulations, you have proper alerts.

If your response more often looks like the second, I'm sorry to say that you don't have *alerts*, you have *notifications*.



## Notes

1. <a name="note1"></a> Not necessarily *you* but the person who is responsible for responding to alerts at that particular time.
