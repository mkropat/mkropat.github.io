Tech blogging is underrated today, at least if you're the type of person who has a way with words and possess knowledge that someone, somewhere finds valuable. While writing blogs has fallen out of fashion, the number of people in tech has only grown, and competing mediums have barely cannibalized the demand for well written websites, which leaves the market wide open.

Let's take a survey:

- __StackOverflow__--and I still ❤️ StackOverflow--is noticeably less helpful than it used to be
- __Video__ is here to stay, but largely serves a parallel demand since text provides more efficient knowledge-transfer in most areas<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>
- __Twitter__ – fun to write on, but dominated by power law dynamics so the median user has approximately 0 reach
- __Tech blogs__--and there a bunch of them--are generally of low quality since most of them are written by beginners<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup>
- __Substack__/__Newsletters__ – in a way this is the new face of blogging, but peculiarly eschews search algorithm driven traffic

My goal in writing is first to give away useful knowledge, and secondarily to build an audience that could be tapped into later.<sup><a href="#note-3">3</a></sup> For either goal, I think you can make a strong case for writing a tech blog over any of the above listed alternatives.

To talk numbers, this blog gets roughly ~3,000 visitors/month and has ~250 subscribers. That is with a blogging schedule that is--to put it mildly--*infrequent*. I estimate that with regular time investment--especially with an eye towards readership--that it would be reasonable over the course of a few years to 5–10x the number of visitors.

Having an email subscription option for your blog has become table stakes since ~2020 or so.<sup><a href="#note-4">4</a></sup>

### Notes

1. <a name="note-1"></a> In theory video can be significantly more efficient than text, and sometimes is, but the common case is the opposite.
1. <a name="note-2"></a> This isn't a bad thing! I encourage beginners to blog because it is often the best way to learn through the method of doing followed by explaining. Also, due to the curse of knowledge, the very best explanations frequently come from someone who recently went from not knowing to knowing. For purposes of this post, however, my point is that it is easy to out-compete beginner level writing ability and beginner level knowledge.
1. <a name="note-3"></a> Typically this is for direct monetization purposes. In contrast, my intention is to build a readily-available audience for possible future (business) project ideas.
1. <a name="note-4"></a> Sorry, I don't have an email subscription option for this blog yet. I intend to add one but my priority is making the implementation work fun over getting it done quickly. Don't worry, I won't add one of those annoying email subscription popups!
