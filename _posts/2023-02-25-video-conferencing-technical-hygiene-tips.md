There is something you need to be made aware of. How to explain it. What? No, nothing like that. It's not your person hygiene--you're always well groomed. You see, it’s your *technical* hygiene.

A couple years ago nobody understood how to do video conferencing right. Then the pandemic happened and--it took time--but we generally figured it out. Except… you didn't get the memo.

That's OK, don't worry! I'll teach you what you need to know with 3 tips. Then awkward calls will be a thing of the past.

## 1. Get a headset

*Don't be like Dr. Floyd*

It is kind of crazy that we live in the long-predicted future where we routinely talk to each other over video calls. Yet--for those of you old enough to remember talking to people over the telephone--have you ever stopped to wonder why telephone conversations generally flowed naturally, while video calls, with all our 21st century technology, are filled with "oh, sorry, you go" followed by "no, you go"?

With in-person conversation we have subtle physical cues (eye contact in particular) to navigate conversational turn-taking. So it makes sense that video calls, which don't telegraph subtle cues particularly well, would be more awkward than in-person conversation. But even when talking with someone 1-1, video calls are noticeably more awkward than old-school telephone calls, and telephone calls can't convey non-auditory cues at all! So we must be doing something wrong.

#### Talking over each other is good, actually

Assuming you're not a narcissist, you've had it instilled from a young age that talking over other people is rude. This is a good thing. Nothing is more infuriating than being willfully ignored by someone *and then* being expected to listen to what they have to say.

What you may not realize is that healthy, respectful conversation also requires small amounts of people talking over each other, typically at the margins when switching turns who is talking. Conversation is basically a game of keepy-uppy, where the equivalent of dropping the ball is no-one saying anything. You may not feel this way, but even if you don't, you should know that for many people it feels excruciating to participate in [dead air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_air). As a result, speakers often rely on others to tactfully jump in at natural break points if they have something to say, otherwise the assumption is that the speaker should keep rambling.

Unfortunately, conversational turn-taking stops being natural if even one side of the conversation is using the most common video conferencing setup: an integrated video camera and microphone--or really any setup that triggers *echo suppression*.

#### A cheap headset is better than your current setup

Let me jump to the punch line. Buy one of these:<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>

You could have the latest MacBook Pro and the highest-end, studio-grade microphone and, for purposes of holding a conversation, it would still be worse than using a [$20 headset off of Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=usb+headset).

What was that? Oh, the cheap headset you tried sits uncomfortably on your head? Not a problem. If you have a more comfortable set of headphones or earbuds, use them!

Whatever you go with, it doesn't even need a built-in microphone.<sup><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> You can use a comfortable set of headphones in conjunction with your built-in laptop microphone.

The important thing is that your setup avoids echo suppression.

#### What is echo cancellation and echo suppression anyway?

## 2. Plug your computer into an Ethernet cable

It is not that Wi-Fi can't work. If you are working from an office with a professionally installed and managed Wi-Fi network, you can likely ignore this section. **But for those of us working from home…**

Yes, I understand that your subscribe to the highest-tier internet plan.

Yes, I understand you bought a well-reviewed home router system.

Yes, I understand that your internet has been "fast" for you all day.

You still need to plug your computer into an Ethernet cable for internet. No, not for every meeting. Short calls are fine on Wi-Fi. If it is a sunny day out, I fully encourage you to join the call from outside.

The rest of the time? If you are going to work from home regularly, take the time to run an Ethernet cable to whatever functions as your home office. No Ethernet jack on your computer? No problem:

#### Latency is the conversation killer


#### If you insist on using Wi-Fi

If you must use Wi-Fi, make sure your Wi-Fi settings show that you are connecting over the 5 GHz (or 6 GHz) frequency band. The 2.4 GHz band is prone to interference. Just about every wireless device in your house is competing to use the 2.4 GHz band. Plus the most random electrical things will generate interference on that band, most notoriously Microwave ovens.

## 3. Sit facing the light

*(Or stand, if that's your thing)*

## Inspiration

I was ignorant about everything in this post until I read Ben Kuhn's 2020 post, [How to make video calls almost as good as face-to-face](https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/). The advice is timeless. However I noticed that too many of my co-workers haven't heard the good news, so I felt compelled to write a take in my own voice.

### Notes

1. <a name="note-1"></a> Ben Kuhn [strongly recommends open-back headphones](https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/#hear-yourself-clearly-with-open-back-headphones), which avoids the awkwardness of not being able to hear your own voice clearly when talking. I haven't tried it myself, as cheap headsets work just fine for me for extended periods, but maybe it is a make-or-break thing for you.
1. <a name="note-2"></a> If you can swing it, be aware that the closer you can get the microphone to your mouth, the better. A headset mic is close to ideal. A studio microphone installed with a proper support system can be even better, but an order of magnitude more effort to get right. An inline mic or Airpods isn't bad. A studio mic that's like more than a foot away from your mouth is actually worse than that. The lowest tier (but still fine!) is relying on your laptop's built-in mic.
