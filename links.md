I fell out of the habit of checking tech news aggregator sites (Hacker News etc.) back in 2012. Twitter/X was fun for a while but then the circles I followed dissolved. Occasionally I summon the interest to check Reddit, but that's it.

Having been around the internet [since before all that](/2015/12/04/choosing-an-http-status-code.html), it was natural for me to return to the habits of a simpler time. RSS is alive and well if you know where to look. The way discoverability on the old web worked was one site linking to another and it still works today.
